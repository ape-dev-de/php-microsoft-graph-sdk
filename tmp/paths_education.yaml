A submission for a points assignment (one that has a point value assigned) has both an educationFeedbackOutcome and an educationPointsOutcome. A submission for an assignment with an attached rubric, if the rubric is a credit rubric (no points), has an educationFeedbackOutcome and an educationRubricOutcome. (It might also return an educationPointsOutcome, but that outcome is ignored.) A submission for an assignment with an attached rubric, if the rubric is a points rubric, has an educationFeedbackOutcome, an educationPointsOutcome, and an educationRubricOutcome. A submission for a feedback resource has an educationFeedbackResourceOutcome. All outcome types have a regular and a published property appropriate to that type of outcome; for example, points and publishedPoints, feedback and publishedFeedback. The regular property is the most recent value updated by the teacher; the published property is the most recent value returned to the student.'

      summary: List assignments of a user
      description: 'Returns a list of educationAssignment assigned to a educationUser for all classes. Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation. This method allows a caller to find all the assignments belonging to a student or a teacher in a single call rather than having to request assignments from each class. The assignment list contains what is needed to get the detailed information for the assignment from within the class namespace. Use the methods defined for the assignment for all other operations.'

Updating a rubric attached to an assignment (PATCH /education/classes/{class-id}/assignments/{assignment-id}/rubric) is only possible before the assignment is published, and what is updated is actually the original rubric that exists under /education/users/{id}/rubrics. After the assignment is published, an immutable copy of the rubric is made that is attached to that specific assignment. That rubric can be retrieved using GET /education/classes/{class-id}/assignments/{assignment-id}/rubric, but it can''t be updated.'
